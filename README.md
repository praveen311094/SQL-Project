Aim of Project:

The aim of this project is to analyze a hotel's database and extract valuable information that can be used for decision-making, such as identifying the most popular room types, calculating total revenue, and determining the occupancy rate.

Skills Used in SQL:

The project requires the use of various SQL skills, including creating tables, writing simple and complex queries, using aggregate functions to calculate statistics such as average and total revenue, subqueries to extract data from nested tables, joins to combine data from multiple tables, and grouping to summarize data by specific attributes.

Insights Drawn:

Some of the insights that can be drawn from the analysis of the hotel database include the most popular room types, the total revenue generated by double rooms, the number of rooms in each hotel and their occupancy rate, the average number of bookings per hotel, and the lost income from unoccupied rooms. 
These insights can help hotel managers make informed decisions about pricing, room allocation, and marketing strategies to increase occupancy rates and revenue.
